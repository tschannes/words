My Childhood. My education. My last job. Don't worry. No such thing here. Of course I was born and raised by the greatest of parents, went to school and did some work. But I shall be so kind as to spare you the details. If you ask nicely (and bribe me with chocolate cake) I might be inclined to give you my mamma's number. So you can learn for yourself.

Right. To the point. Usually, I abhor introductions. Introductory pieces of writing, just like the paragraph you just endured, are what keeps me busy professionally.

As a writer, I am obliged by my occupation, to constantly remind myself and those around me not to loose ourselves in the beauties of linguistic intricacies. But then again, once off-duty I am weak, as you can see.

Another thing I tell my clients over and over again, is that there is no point in telling people what is right and wrong, better or worse. The same applies to giving strangers an impression of who you are. You could do all the official labels, like name, schooling, what kind of cake you like and so forth. 

> As a linguist and student of literatures, I tend to favour an entirely different approach. It is not the 'what' that makes people who they are. It's the 'how'.

While being quite easy to capture an individuals style of speaking, writing or walking across a street, the same is not true for companies and brands. Companies naturally tend to have a variety of different voices. There are the academics, there are secretaries, there are people who love to write copious amounts of senseless copy and those whose writings read like shopping lists. 

Currently, I am trying to figure out just how one can master these many-faced behemoths called brands. How can we, as information strategists, reduce the number of drastically differing voices? Or how can we turn the cacophony into something more like a concert?

On this page, I hope to shed some light on how we might achieve companies and brands, that speak with one voice, that show us one face, and that let us know who they are by **how** they speak.
